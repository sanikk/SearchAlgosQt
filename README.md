# SearchAlgosQt

C++ Qt version of my project, originally for the course
Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence Project, Laboratory work
TKT20010 at University of Helsinki.

I've been using this to learn the basics of C++.

Here is the non-Qt C++ version: https://github.com/sanikk/algolabra-cpp

And the original Python version, with PyQt6: https://github.com/sanikk/algolabra
