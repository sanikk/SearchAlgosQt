# SearchAlgosQt

C++ Qt version of my project, originally for the course
Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence Project, Laboratory work
TKT20010 at University of Helsinki.

I've been using this to learn the basics of C++. This version started from hello world.

Here is the non-Qt C++ version: https://github.com/sanikk/algolabra-cpp

And the original Python version, with PyQt6: https://github.com/sanikk/algolabra

Maps are from the wonderful people at [MovingAI](https://www.movingai.com/). I just provide them here for
convenience.

[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) is of course not my project, I just use it. I think it's nice for UIs.
